# Prettier configuration

We are using Prettier to ensure our codebase is formatted in the same way and avoid conflicts.

To access Prettier settings on VSCode, go to Settings > Search for 'prettier'

The following are settings we've updated from the default:

![Prettier: Jsx Single Quote (ticked) Use single quotes instead of double quotes in JSX.](assets/image.png)

![Prettier: Single Quote (ticked) Use single instead of double quotes](assets/image-1.png)

![Prettier: Use Tabs (ticked) Indent lines with tabs.](assets/image-2.png)

![Editor: Default Formatter Defines a default formatter which takes precedence over all other formatter settings. Must be the identifier of an extension contributing a formatter. Set to 'Prettier - Code formatter'](assets/image-3.png)
